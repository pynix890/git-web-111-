    In a hypertext document, any word or phrase can be “hyperlinked” to information related to that word or phrase residing in the same document or in another document. When a hyperlink is activated, the hypertext system retrieves the related information. For example, by selecting a word in a sentence, the definition of that word is retrieved.

    Some hypertext systems allow users to see who has visited a certain document or link, or how often a link has been followed, thus giving users a basic awareness of what other users are doing in the system. Another common multiuser feature in hypertext is the ability for any user to create links in documents authored by others so that the original author can become aware of new related material.
